This code is a data science tools project, in which we scrape data from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ about corona virus to analyze the data and visualize and gain insights from it.

The file with "SL" in it is the same code, but with streamlit applied, so you can interact with the visualizations and understand them better.

To be able to run the streamlit web app, you simply open command prompt and type "streamlit run (dictionary for where it's downloaded". So for example: streamlit run C:\Users\User\Downloads\COVID_Impact_SL

Of course you have to keep in mind that you need to change the file paths in the code according to your own PC

Also, we used MongoDB to be able to store the data we have in MongoDB, so you will need to install MongoDB if you want to use that feature
